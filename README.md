<H2>What is Devops</H2>
<p>DevOps (“development” and “operations”) is the combination of practices and tools designed to increase an
    organization's ability to deliver applications and services faster than traditional software development processes.
    <br>
    Devops is an approach for developing and delivering software faster than traditional development processes by automating  tasks.</p>

<h2>CI/CD</h2>

<p>CI/CD means continous integration and continous delivery or deployment . It is a devops process to automate software
    delivery by automating tasks like build-test and deploy.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Continous Integration:</b>is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple developers into a single codebase. It helps to find and address bugs quicker, make the process of integrating code across a team of developers easier, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to release new feature updates.</li>
    <li><b>Continous Delivery:</b> the process of automating build, test, configuration, and deployment from a build to a production environment. It is a process to make sure that software is ready and can be released any time. </li>
    <li><b>Continous Deployment:</b> is a software development practice that refers to the automated deployment of code changes to production. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Pipeline</h2>
<p>A  pipeline is a set of automated processes and tools that the development and operations teams use to compile, construct, test, and deploy software code faster and easier
    A pipeline consists of a set of tools which are classified into the following categories such as:
    <ul>
        <li>Source control</li>
        <li>Build tools</li>
        <li>Containerization</li>
        <li>Configuration management</li>
        <li>Monitoring</li>
     </ul>
